This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2516

Mainly light-blue and green on a light-green background.
It is my first vim color scheme, and I don't know much about colors, so it may be not so good as I have expected. But I wish it is useful. Any suggestion, please email me.
